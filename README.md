#VCFsplit

This script aims to split consolidated VCF contact entries as listed in the Nokia 220's backup.dat file into separate VCF contact files to allow ease of importing into other address books or programs.

Ensure that the script and the "backup.dat" file are in the same folder and run:

python VCF_split.py

Contacts will be placed in the same folder as the python script.
